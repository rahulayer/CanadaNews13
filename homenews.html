            color: #555;">A Vancouver real estate lawyer who admitted to misappropriating more than $8 million from client trust funds to feed his gambling addiction has been banned from practising law for seven years.
Russell Sean McDonough signed a consent agreement with the Law Society of B.C. last week, admitting to professional misconduct in 34 instances of misappropriation over about 22 months, according to a summary posted online.
It says McDonough admitted he started taking the money from his clients beginning in 2021 after amassing a substantial amount of debt from gambling and exhausting all of his credit sources.
He said he would issue trust cheques to his personal law corporation and then gamble the funds, believing he'd have a "breakthrough" win that would cover both his debts and the trust fund shortfall.

                color: #555;">cDonough attempted to explain his thought process in a letter to the law society on April 14, 2023, explaining that his life had become "completely consumed" by gambling.
"I appreciate that my thought processes that resulted in the actions and the conduct itself do not seem rational. However, at the time I was making these decisions, I felt as if I had no other choice. It was true compulsion. Every withdrawal I made from the firm's trust account and every dishonest act was a result of my gambling activity," he said.
McDonough described his conduct as inexcusable and said he intends to be accountable to everyone who was affected.
"I am full of remorse and shame over what I have done. In examining my behaviour to prepare these responses, I was appalled," he wrote.</p>
